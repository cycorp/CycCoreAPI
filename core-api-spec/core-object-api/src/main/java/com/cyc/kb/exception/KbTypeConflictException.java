/**
 * Thrown when an entity exists in the KB, but is incompatible with a particular
 * semantic object type. The difference between this exception and
 * <code>KbTypeException</code> is that in this case, the KB entity cannot be
 * turned into the expected type by addition of assertions--instead, there is an
 * existing assertion on the KB entity that specifically conflicts with the
 * desired type. In contrast, a <code>KbTypeException</code> signals that the KB
 * entity is not of the desired type, but does not signal that there is a
 * conflict between some existing assertion and the desired type. For a simple
 * <code>KbTypeException</code>, it is possible that simply adding more
 * assertions will turn the KB entity into the desired type of entity.
